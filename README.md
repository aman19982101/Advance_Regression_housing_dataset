## General Information
- This project is about how Regularisation helps in improving the Standart Linear Regression model to achieve higher accuracy.The dataset used for this project is the housing dataset.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Regularisation can help Linear Regression model to be simpler and generalisable by penalising the model with the error term. This helps the model to not overfit on the dataset.
